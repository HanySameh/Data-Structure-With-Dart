# Linked Lists

A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear, unidirectional sequence. It has several theoretical advantages over contiguous storage options such as the Dart List:

- Constant time insertion and removal from the front of the list.
- Reliable performance characteristics.

## Key Points

- Linked lists are linear and unidirectional. As soon as you move a reference from one node to another, you canâ€™t go back.
- Linked lists have O(1) time complexity for head first insertions, whereas standard lists have O(n) time complexity for head-first insertions.
- Implementing the Dart Iterable interface allows you to loop through the elements of a collection as well as offering a host of other helpful methods.
