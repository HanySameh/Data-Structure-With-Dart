# Data structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing real-life data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

# Algorithms
is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines.

## Why should you learn data structures and algorithms?

Data structures are different from the primitive data types, but they are similar to them in the sense that it holds (structures) same data into certain predefined manners.

When we study data structure and algorithm, we are talking (and concern) about space (RAM) and processing (CPU) efficiency. Both processing power and memory are finite. So we need to keep things optimized so that it takes the least amount of space and processing time. You won’t want your Lambda function to be running forever, would you? You would want it to take the least amount of time and take the least amount of space, right?

- Interviews: An important reason to keep your algorithmic skills up to par is to prepare for 
interviews. Most companies have at least one or two algorithmic questions to test 
your abilities as an engineer. A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms 
is the “bar” for many software engineering positions.

- Work: Using an appropriate data structure is crucial when working with lots of data, and 
using the right algorithm plays a significant role in the performance and scalability 
of your software. Your mobile apps will be more responsive and have better battery 
life. Your server apps will be able to handle more concurrent requests and use less 
energy. Algorithms often include proofs of correctness that you can leverage to build 
better software.
Using the correct data structure also helps to provide context to the reader. As an 
example, you might come across a Set in your code base. Immediately, you can 
deduce:
  - Consumers of the Set don’t care about the order of the elements, since Set is an 
     unordered collection.
  - Set also ensures that there are no duplicate values. You can assume consumers are 
     working with unique data.
  - Set is great for checking for value membership, so it’s likely the engineer 
    introduced it for this purpose.
Being familiar with a data structures allows you to extract additional context from 
the code. This is a powerful skill that will help you understand how a piece of 
software works.

- Self-Improvement: Knowing the strategies used by algorithms to solve tricky problems gives you ideas 
for improvements that you can make to your code. The Dart core library has a small 
set of general-purpose collection types; they don’t cover every case. And, yet, as 
you’ll see, these primitives can be used as a great starting point for building more 
complex and special-purpose abstractions. Knowing more data structures than just 
the common ones gives you a wider range of tools that you can use to build your 
apps.
