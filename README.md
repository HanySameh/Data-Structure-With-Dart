# Data structures
are a well-studied discipline, and the concepts are language 
agnostic; A data structure from C is functionally and conceptually identical to the 
same data structure in any other language, such as Dart. At the same time, the high- 
level expressiveness of Dart makes it an ideal choice for learning these core concepts 
without sacrificing too much performance.

# Algorithms
on the other hand, are a set of operations that complete a task. This can 
be a sorting algorithm that moves data around to put it in order. Or it can be an 
algorithm that compresses an 8K picture to a manageable size. Algorithms are 
essential to software, and many have been created to act as building blocks for useful 
programs.

## Why should you learn data structures and algorithms?
- Interviews: An important reason to keep your algorithmic skills up to par is to prepare for 
interviews. Most companies have at least one or two algorithmic questions to test 
your abilities as an engineer. A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms 
is the “bar” for many software engineering positions.

- Work: Using an appropriate data structure is crucial when working with lots of data, and 
using the right algorithm plays a significant role in the performance and scalability 
of your software. Your mobile apps will be more responsive and have better battery 
life. Your server apps will be able to handle more concurrent requests and use less 
energy. Algorithms often include proofs of correctness that you can leverage to build 
better software.
Using the correct data structure also helps to provide context to the reader. As an 
example, you might come across a Set in your code base. Immediately, you can 
deduce:
  - Consumers of the Set don’t care about the order of the elements, since Set is an 
     unordered collection.
  - Set also ensures that there are no duplicate values. You can assume consumers are 
     working with unique data.
  - Set is great for checking for value membership, so it’s likely the engineer 
    introduced it for this purpose.
Being familiar with a data structures allows you to extract additional context from 
the code. This is a powerful skill that will help you understand how a piece of 
software works.

- Self-Improvement: Knowing the strategies used by algorithms to solve tricky problems gives you ideas 
for improvements that you can make to your code. The Dart core library has a small 
set of general-purpose collection types; they don’t cover every case. And, yet, as 
you’ll see, these primitives can be used as a great starting point for building more 
complex and special-purpose abstractions. Knowing more data structures than just 
the common ones gives you a wider range of tools that you can use to build your 
apps.
