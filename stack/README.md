# Stack

The stack data structure is similar in concept to a physical 
stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. 
When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item. 
Stacks are useful and also exceedingly simple. The main goal of building a stack is 
to enforce how you access your data.

## Stack Operations

- push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- pop: Remove the top element of the stack.

## Key Points

- A stack is a LIFO, last-in first-out, data structure.
- Despite being so simple, the stack is a key data structure for many problems.
- The only two essential operations for a stack are push for adding elements and pop for removing elements.
- push and pop are both constant-time operations.
